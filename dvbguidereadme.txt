Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This beta version is released as a precursor to a new full release of DVBGuide.  The documentation included here refers to the last full release (i.e. 0.90) and therefore does not cover new features present in this beta release.  As usual, entering "DVBGuide -?" on the command will display a usage message that summarises all command line options (i.e. including new options present in this beta).

The main changes since version 0.90 are:

* Revised signal lock/acquisiation mechanism (yet again!) for better compatibility with a minority of tuners;

* Generation of Guide data in MXF format for direct loading into Windows 7 using Microsoft supplied "loadmxf" utility;

* Support for channel logo references in Windows 7 MXF data;

* Updated decode tables (based on observed broadcasts to date) for the UK's Freesat EPG;

* Various minor improvements to the meta data accompanying programme descriptions in the generated Guide data.
